## Overview
Welcome to the Flying Bear Animation Project, an interactive and visually engaging web application featuring a sneakily watching bear that gains the power of flight in the navBar, thanks to the magic of GSAP animations.

## Technology Stack
This project is built using a robust set of technologies ensuring both efficiency and high performance:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, ensuring a responsive and dynamic experience.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A powerful animation library used to give life to the website elements, particularly our star, the bear.
- **ScrollTrigger**: A GSAP plugin for creating animations that start and progress based on the user's scroll position.

## Features
- **Interactive Animations**: Watch as the bear gains the power to fly, moving gracefully across the screen.
- **Sneaky Bear**: Our bear doesn't just fly; it sneakily watches from the side, adding an element of surprise and delight.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.
- **Dynamic Content**: Experience the dynamic loading of content as you interact with the website.

## Flying Bear Animation
One of the key highlights of this project is the flying bear animated using GSAP. This animation is not just a visual treat but also a demonstration of advanced GSAP capabilities. As you scroll through the site, the bear gains flight, and at a certain point, it starts watching sneakily from the side, showcasing a blend of creativity and technical prowess.
